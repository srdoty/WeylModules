# The Weyl modules package

This is the README file for the GAP package "WeylModules". You must
have a working copy of GAP installed in order to use this package.

The package provides functions for doing computations with Weyl modules
in positive characteristic for a semisimple simply-connected algebraic
group. 

The package is not yet submitted to GAP.  For updates between releases
of GAP itself check the package Web page, at
http://doty.math.luc.edu/weylmodules.
  
After downloading the package, start GAP in the download folder, and type:
```
gap> SetPackagePath("WeylModules",".");
gap> LoadPackage("WeylModules");
```
You can also run `ExtendRootDirectories` to tell GAP where to
find the package. (See Chapter 76 of the
[GAP Manual](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap76.html).)

For details on how to use the WeylModules package see the package
documentation in the `doc` subdirectory.
